# OnlyChat

Welcome to my project repository! This project showcases the various programming concepts and techniques I have learned. The primary focus is on understanding and implementing these concepts rather than perfecting the design or creating production-ready solutions.

OnlyChat is a simple chat application that leverages an external API to provide real-time messaging capabilities.
